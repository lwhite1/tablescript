# tablescript
a  scripting language for tablesaw

I'm not sure how far I will take this, at present it is a hobby effort, but it's something I've wanted to do for a few years so, maybe.

The general idea is to write an interpreted, dynamically typed language that will get transpiled to Java and execute tablesaw commands in a more user-friendly way than is possible with native java tablesaw. 

I will provide additional information as the design solidifies.
